This is my very first Google Assistant app called [UV Check](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000533364b564?hl=en-US) which provides real-time UV index at any U.S. location.

It is created on [Dialogflow](http://console.dialogflow.com/), [Actions on Goolge](http://console.actions.google.com/), and [Google App Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine) (webhook in Python).
